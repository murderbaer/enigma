# Frontend

## Introduction

The frontend uses [vuejs.org](https://vuejs.org/) as it's is also being taught at the university.
This should allow most students to get started with the project quickly.

I use [bun.sh](https://bun.sh/) to manage the dependencies and build the project but npm or yarn
should also work fine.

## Quickstart

```bash
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash # Install bun
bun install                              # Install dependencies
bun dev                                  # Start the development server
```
